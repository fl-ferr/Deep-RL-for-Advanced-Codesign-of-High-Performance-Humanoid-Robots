\chapter{Contact Parameters Tuning}

As explained in \cref{sec:back_contacts}, the choice of the integrator, the integration step size, and the contact parameters can have a significant impact on the simulation results. In this section, we present the results of the contact parameters tuning process, which is the spine of the simulation in \jaxsim.
