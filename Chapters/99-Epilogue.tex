This work presented a novel framework based on the combination of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms for the codesign humanoid robots supported by the most recent advances in the field of hardware acceleration. In particular, it answers the research question:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{
        How can a set of parameter values be found that optimizes the performance of a humanoid robot in a given task?}
\end{quote}

and in particular, it addresses the problem of finding the optimal motor parameters for the locomotion task. It addressed also the problem of the lack of a simulation environment that allows for a computation of the forward dynamics that takes into account the presence of motors mounted on the joints of the robot, allowing for a potentially smaller gap between the simulation and the real world application.
The framework was tested on a simple, yet easily scalable environment, and the results showed that the proposed framework is able to find a set of motor parameters that allows for a better reward in the reinforcement learning framework.
The proposed framework could be propelled by the recent advances in the field of hardware acceleration.
